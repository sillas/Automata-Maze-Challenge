**Repository Description:**

This repository contains the scripts and solutions for the challenge of creating a cellular automaton, a task designed to test the developer's ability to create efficient and creative computational solutions. The cellular automaton is a simple yet powerful computational model that can be applied to a wide range of problems. Through this challenge, the goal is to evaluate the ability to solve problems in an innovative and optimized manner.

The scripts include the implementation of the cellular automaton based on the provided instructions, as well as answers and discussions on different approaches and improvements made throughout the process. This repository serves as an example of how creative approaches can be applied to complex computational problems, offering a solid foundation for the development of efficient algorithms.

**Repository Structure:**
- `Fase 1/`: Contains the base challenge.
- `Fase 2/`: Contains more complex challenges.

This repository serves both as an educational example and as a portfolio of computational problem-solving solutions.
